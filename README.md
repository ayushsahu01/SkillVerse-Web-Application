📌 SkillVerse – Learn, Teach, and Grow Together

Project Name:
SkillVerse

Project Category:
Education / EdTech

Problem Statement:
Many learners face barriers such as expensive courses, lack of personalized mentoring, and limited opportunities to practice skills in real-world contexts. At the same time, skilled individuals often lack platforms to share knowledge or earn informally. There is currently no unified platform where users can both learn through structured content and exchange skills with others in a collaborative, community-driven environment.

Project Short Description:
SkillVerse is a next-generation collaborative e-learning platform that enables users to access structured online courses and also participate in a peer-to-peer skill exchange ecosystem. It empowers learners to become teachers and fosters a culture of continuous, community-based learning.

Project Long Description:
SkillVerse bridges the gap between structured learning and practical skill application through two integrated modules:

1. Structured Learning Hub:

Users can enroll in curated free or premium courses across domains like technology, design, business, and creative arts.

Each course offers videos, downloadable notes, quizzes, hands-on projects, and certificates.

Learners can track their progress via a dashboard and receive personalized course recommendations based on interests and learning history.


2. Skill Swap Marketplace:

Every user has a “Skill Wallet” that lists the skills they possess and those they want to acquire.

Users can connect with peers to exchange skills — for example, "I’ll help you learn Photoshop if you teach me JavaScript."

Optionally, users can also purchase specialized sessions or complete structured courses.

Features include:

Booking calendar for 1-on-1 sessions or group classes.

Live video classes.

Feedback and rating system for accountability.

Incentivized “Mentor Badges” to reward experienced contributors.



Other Key Features:

AI-based matchmaking engine for recommending compatible skill partners.

Community forums for collaboration, Q&A, and study groups.

Gamification system: Earn SkillPoints, badges, and a “SkillRank” based on activity and impact.

Well-being support feature for students feeling stressed or stuck — includes 1-on-1 guidance and mentorship.

Admin dashboard for managing users, course content, reports, skill exchanges, disputes, and analytics
